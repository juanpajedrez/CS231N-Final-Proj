# Project Description
This repository contains all files related to training and generating synthetic chest X-ray images. It presents a solution to the ongoing need for high-quality, structurally complex medical images while upholding privacy standards.

In this repository, we demonstrate the application of Variational Autoencoders (VAE), Gaussian Mixture VAEs (GMVAE), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), along with convolutional neural network encoders, to generate synthetic chest X-ray images that reflect various medical conditions, such as pneumonia, effusion, and pneumothorax.
